SRTabBarController aims to replicate much of `UITabBarController`'s functionality for OS X. It acts as a visual tab bar for `NSTabView` and has a number of nifty features.

- Add tabs using segues right within your storyboard.
- Set text color, tint color, bar color, and item spacing in Interface Builder.
- Choose from 4 positions: Top, Bottom, Left, Right.
- Supports text & image, text only or image only tabs.
- Use translucent effects via `NSVisualEffectsView`.
- Written in Swift.

## Installation

SRTabBarController can be installed manually by including all files within the `Pod` directory in your project. However, installation via CocoaPods is recommended.
