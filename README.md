`SRTabBarController` aims to replicate much of `UITabBarController`'s functionality for macOS It acts as a visual tab bar for `NSTabView` and has a number of nifty features.

- Add tabs using segues right within your storyboard.
- Set text color, tint color, bar color, and item spacing in Interface Builder.
- Choose from 4 positions: Top, Bottom, Left, Right.
- Supports text & image, text only or image only tabs.
- Use translucent effects via `NSVisualEffectsView`.
- Written in Swift.

## Installation

SRTabBarController can be installed manually by including all files within the `Pod` directory in your project. However, installation via CocoaPods is recommended.

````ruby
pod 'SRTabBarController', :git => 'https://github.com/steve228uk/SRTabBarController.git'
````

## Usage

While `SRTabBarController` can be added to your project programatically, it is recommended that you use it in your storyboard. Just like `UITabBarController` tabs can be defined via segues. As custom relationship segues are unsupported as workaround has been used that utilises custom segues and identifiers to define tabs.

**1 -** Drag a new `UIViewController` into your storyboard and set it as the root content view controller for your window.
**2 -** Set the class of the new controller to be `SRTabBarController` ensuring that the bundle is set correctly.

**3 -** Define tab bar properties from the Attributes inspector on the `SRTabBarController`.

**4 -** Create your view controllers for each tab and link your `SRTabBarController` to them using a Custom segue.

**5 -** Ensure each tab view controller has a title defined in the attributes inspector. This is used as the title of the tab.

**6 -** Okay, this is the trickiest part. Click on each of the segues you just created and define the following in the attributes inspector.

The index here defines the position it will be displayed in the tab bar. Optionally, you can provide the name of a **default** image within your app's assets. For example if you had a search tab that you wanted to be at position 1 and have an icon called Search you would set the following as the identifier `tab_1_Search`.

## Customizing SRTabBarController

Alongside the settings that can be defined within Interface Builder's inspector there are also a number of options that can be set by subclassing `SRTabBarController`. The `SRTabBar` itself is actually an `NSVisualEffectsView` so it's very easy to get those translucent effects users are familiar with in macOS.

**Location** - To customize the location on the screen set `tabBarLocation` to `.top`, `.right`, `.bottom`, or `.left`.

**Translucency** - To enable the visual effects turn set `tabBar?.translucent = true`.

**Visual Effects** - Check out the `NSVisualEffectsView` for some of the settings that can be enabled for the `tabBar`. You'll most likely want to change the `material` and `blendingMode`.
